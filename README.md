Started tic tac toe project
This will be great practice for objects and factory functions. After the calculator project, I know that I could do this entire project without factory functions, but I want to make sure to get more practice with them. I also want to see if I can do modules with private and public methods. I'll try to not use many global variables so that I can also focus on scope. Also, I want the code to look pretty and be readable, something I struggle with currently

Today I started the project and added some design layout and UI


Attack plan:

1 - Design 

2 - class for the gameboard

3 - add functionality with clicking

4 - first, make it 2 human players

5 - add 1st player (X's) (factory) + (method)

6 - add 2nd player (O's) and alternate players (factory) + (method)

7 - only valid moves allowed (method)

8 - victory or draw conditions (method)

9 - Display curr player (method)

10 - reset button (method)

11 - AI button, w/ 2 difficulties easy and hard (impossible to beat)

12 - AI #1 - Random moves, valid selections only

13 - AI #2 - impossible - ref Odin
