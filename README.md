5/17
Started tic tac toe project
This will be great practice for objects and factory functions. After the calculator project, I know that I could do this entire project without factory functions, but I want to make sure to get more practice with them. I also want to see if I can do modules with private and public methods. I'll try to not use many global variables so that I can also focus on scope. Also, I want the code to look pretty and be readable, something I struggle with currently

Today I started the project and added some design layout and UI

5/18
Pretty productive session actually. Surprisingly, I'm almost done with the game. I finished the design, added a popup that shows which player won, set up victory conditions, only allows valid moves, it updates live with the current player's move, added a reset button, added a few transition elements. I formatted all of my code into a module, this allowed me to keep everything pretty clean. I also used some Jquery for the first time. 
Tomorrow, I want to add the AI's to play against. I also need to add a draw condition

5/18 another quick update, I added check tie conditions, added a popup for a tie, and cleaned up the code for checkwin conditions a little bit

5/19 added an AI that randomly chooses. I also added a bit to the initial form. I want to be able to select 1 player (vs ai) or 2 player (human vs human) I also want to be able to add names to the players, will be working on that next. 
I spent some time trying to learn minimax, to make an AI that is impossible to beat. I can't figure out how to add it to how I designed my game. Maybe I'll dive deeper or maybe i'll save that idea for another day. 

Attack plan:

1 - Design (done)

2 - class for the gameboard (done)

3 - add functionality with clicking (done)

4 - first, make it 2 human players (done)

5 - add 1st player (X's) (factory) + (method)  (done)

6 - add 2nd player (O's) and alternate players (factory) + (method)  (done)

7 - only valid moves allowed (method)  (done)
 
8 - victory or draw conditions (method)  (done)

9 - Display curr player (method) (done)

10 - reset button (method)  (done)
 
11 - AI button, w/ 2 difficulties easy and hard (impossible to beat)

12 - AI #1 - Random moves, valid selections only (done)

13 - AI #2 - impossible - ref Odin



14 - add cool styling, I like the neon effect
